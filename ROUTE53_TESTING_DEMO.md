# Route53 Testing - High-Volume DNS Testing Demo

## Overview

The new **Route53 Testing** tab provides comprehensive DNS routing policy testing with support for high-volume testing (10,000+ queries) similar to the bash scripts you mentioned.

## Key Features

### 1. **High-Volume Testing Support**
- Supports 10,000+ DNS queries for accurate weighted routing analysis
- Uses `dig` command for more accurate results (similar to your bash script)
- Automatic switching to high-volume mode for iterations > 5000

### 2. **Configurable Expected Endpoints**
- **User Input**: Expected endpoints are now configurable inputs (not hardcoded)
- **Weighted Configuration**: For weighted routing, you can specify weights for each endpoint
- **Distribution Analysis**: Shows actual vs expected distribution with deviation percentages

### 3. **Comprehensive Output**

#### Test Results Tab:
- **Test Summary**: Overall result, total queries, success rate, policy compliance
- **Detailed Results**: Individual query results with timestamps and response times
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress during testing

#### Endpoint Distribution Tab:
- **Interactive Charts**: Pie/bar charts showing endpoint distribution
- **Statistical Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of actual vs expected percentages
- **Deviation Analysis**: Shows how much actual distribution deviates from expected

#### Raw Results Tab:
- **Raw Query Output**: Similar to your bash script output
- **Filterable Results**: Filter by success/failure, unique endpoints
- **Export Capability**: Save results to file for analysis

## Example Usage

### High-Volume Weighted Routing Test

1. **Configure Test**:
   - Domain: `example.com`
   - Routing Policy: `WEIGHTED`
   - Test Iterations: `10000`
   - Expected Endpoints: `endpoint1.example.com`, `endpoint2.example.com`

2. **Set Weights**:
   ```
   endpoint1.example.com: Weight 70 (Expected: 70%)
   endpoint2.example.com: Weight 30 (Expected: 30%)
   ```

3. **Run Test**:
   - The system automatically uses high-volume testing mode
   - Uses `dig` command for accurate DNS queries
   - Shows real-time progress and results

### Sample Output

```
High-Volume Weighted Routing Test Results
========================================
Domain: example.com
Total Queries: 10000
Successful Queries: 9987
Failed Queries: 13
Success Rate: 99.87%
Average Response Time: 45ms

Endpoint Distribution:
  endpoint1.example.com: 6991 queries (70.02%) - Expected: 70.0% - Deviation: 0.02%
  endpoint2.example.com: 2996 queries (29.98%) - Expected: 30.0% - Deviation: 0.02%

Sample Raw Results (first 10 queries):
Query 1: example.com -> endpoint1.example.com (42ms)
Query 2: example.com -> endpoint2.example.com (38ms)
Query 3: example.com -> endpoint1.example.com (51ms)
Query 4: example.com -> endpoint1.example.com (44ms)
Query 5: example.com -> endpoint2.example.com (47ms)
...

Test PASSED: Actual distribution matches expected weights within tolerance
```

## Comparison with Bash Script Approach

### Your Bash Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10000}
do
  domain=$(dig <domain-name> <type> @RecursiveResolver_IP +short)
  echo -e  "$domain" >> RecursiveResolver_results.txt
done
```

### Our Implementation:
- **Similar Approach**: Uses `dig` command for DNS queries
- **Enhanced Features**: Real-time progress, statistical analysis, compliance checking
- **Better Performance**: Optimized delays for high-volume testing
- **Comprehensive Output**: Detailed distribution analysis and charts

## Routing Policy Testing

### Supported Policies:
1. **WEIGHTED**: High-volume testing with distribution analysis
2. **GEOLOCATION**: Tor-based testing from multiple locations
3. **LATENCY**: Latency measurement and routing verification
4. **FAILOVER**: Primary/secondary endpoint testing
5. **SIMPLE**: Basic A record resolution testing

### Integration Features:
- **Tor Support**: Geographic diversity testing using Tor exit nodes
- **DNS Server Selection**: Test against different DNS servers
- **Export Options**: Save results in multiple formats
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live progress and result updates

## Getting Started

1. **Launch Application**: Start NetArmyKn1f3
2. **Navigate to Route53 Testing Tab**
3. **Configure Test Parameters**:
   - Enter domain name
   - Select routing policy
   - Set test iterations (use 10000+ for weighted testing)
   - Configure expected endpoints
4. **Run Test**: Click "Start Route53 Test"
5. **Analyze Results**: View detailed results and distribution charts

## Benefits

✅ **Accurate Testing**: Uses same `dig` command as your bash scripts
